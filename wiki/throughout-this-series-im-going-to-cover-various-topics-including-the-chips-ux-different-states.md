Throughout this series, I'm going to cover various topics, including **the Chips UX**, different states they can have, how to stylize them, and common use cases where Chips are employed in UX patterns.

**_Chip_** — is a small, interactive component that serves as a visual representation of a specific input of attribute or an action. Also known as a [Tag](https://materialx.crionic.net/components/tag) or [Badge](https://www.setproduct.com/blog/badge-ui-design), a Chip typically consists of a simple shape or container with succinct text or an icon, often accompanied by additional visual cues or status indicators.

Chips are commonly used to showcase various types of content, such as categories, labels, status tags, or product attributes. By allowing users to click or tap on them, Chips can trigger actions, facilitate [filtering options](https://www.setproduct.com/blog/filter-ui-design), or display more item's details.

By the end of this **UI design tutorial**, you will have a solid understanding of how to create visually appealing and user-friendly Chip components that enhance the overall experience of your application.

## Chips Anatomy
